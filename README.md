## Introduction

*First project for the Odin Project course. This project is a simple recipe book. Simple, right ?*

## Information

1. *Obviously, I know a bit more about HTML, CSS and JS but since I'm following the Odin project I follow the guidelines. It's not beautiful but it's intentional* ðŸ˜†

2. *You can make the lasagna recipe, it's a real one, trust me* ðŸ˜„
